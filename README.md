# Orrery

An orrery in PyGame, based on code from [pico-solar-system](https://github.com/dr-mod/pico-solar-system)

## Usage

Press **left and right cursor** keys to advance by a single day, **up and down cursor** keys to advance by 30 days, or **page up and down** to advance by 365 days.

Press **Return** to jump back to today's date; press **A** to toggle animation. In the HD version, **F** toggles fast animation speed.

In the HD version, pressing **D** toggles true distance mode where the orbits are drawn at their true average solar distances. Use **+ and -** to zoom in and out. Angles between planets are closer to reality in this view, especially if the outer planets are involved.
